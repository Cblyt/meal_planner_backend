        "Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until starting to brown, then pour in the wine. Leave to bubble and cook away.",

        "Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and giving it a stir after 30 minutes \u2013 if it looks a little dry at this stage, add a splash of water to help it along.",
        "About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.",
        "Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then return to the pan with a few spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.",
        "Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, if needed.",
        "Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of Bolognese to each, then serve with a fine grating of Parmesan."
