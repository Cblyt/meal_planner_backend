        "Place a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat with 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the popping corn and cover with a lid. Once popped, add a few generous shakes of Tabasco, toss together and tip into a large salad bowl.",
        "In the same pan, grill the corn until lightly charred all over, turning regularly, then remove.",
        "Season with a small pinch of salt and pepper and mix well. Spoon out a few tablespoons of the marinade and set it aside.",
        "Add the chicken breasts to the bowl with the remaining marinade. Turn them over in the marinade so theyâ€™re well coated, cover with clingfilm and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes or until the grill is ready.",
        "If using a griddle pan, put it over high heat now to get it screaming hot.",
        "Use tongs to transfer your chicken breasts onto the grill or griddle pan. For chicken breasts approximately 2cm thick, cook for about 5 minutes on each side, turning every minute and basting as you go, or until golden and cooked through.",
        "Spoon a little of the reserved sauce over each breast."
